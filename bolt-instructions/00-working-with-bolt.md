# Working with Bolt in Multiple Sets

Due to file upload limitations, I'll be providing the complete Vice Kink mobile app instructions in multiple sets. Here's how we'll proceed:

## Upload Structure

1. **Set 1 (Initial Setup)**
   - 00-main-instructions.md (This overview)
   - 01-project-overview.md
   - 02-tech-stack.md
   - 03-database-structure.md
   - 04-authentication.md

2. **Set 2 (Core Features & UI)**
   - 05-core-features.md
   - 06-ui-components.md
   - 07-screens-navigation.md
   - 08-data-management.md

3. **Set 3 (Implementation & Deployment)**
   - 09-features-implementation.md
   - 10-deployment.md
   - 11-bolt-prompt.md (Complete prompt template)

## Working Process

1. **Review Each Set**: After I upload each set, take time to review and understand the content before proceeding.

2. **Incremental Building**: We'll build the app incrementally, starting with project structure and authentication, then moving to features and UI.

3. **Consistent Communication**: Provide updates after implementing major features so we can verify functionality matches the web version.

4. **Testing**: Test each component thoroughly on both iOS and Android to ensure cross-platform compatibility.

## Expected Timeline

1. **Initial Setup**: Project creation, Supabase connection, authentication system
2. **Core Features**: User profiles, discovery, matching, messaging
3. **Content Features**: Posts, communities, interactions
4. **Polish & Deployment**: Final touches, testing, and app store preparation

Let me know when you're ready for the first set of instructions, and we'll begin the rebuild process!
